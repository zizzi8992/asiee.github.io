Teary waterfall

These days seem to be peaceful and calm, so I decide to paint something that resembles my feeling. Therefore I painted this beautiful waterfall, inspired by Correa Art. this painting was made on 17th September 2022, and as usual on my weekend I painted it.

This is my very first landscape painting because before I usually did portraits on canvas. I begin with the sky, and then paint the vegetative beside the waterfall, and then the cliff, continue with the base color of the waterfall itself, and lastly the river flow below.

What I found difficult in this painting is to differentiate the ripple of the water, but I think I am getting better at painting clouds. I am proud of myself for making little progress. My favorite part of the painting is the vegetation above the cliff because it makes the painting looks alive. What do you think?
