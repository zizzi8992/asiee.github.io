cloudy neighborhood

this is my second painting on canvas, I painted it on 4th September 2022. It took me two weeks to finish the painting, not because it is hard but because I am inconsistent to paint it. I am inspired by @tiinasdairy paint on TikTok, I add gloomy cloud vibes. because the story that I want to show is about that day a girl in the yellow apartment building is planning to take a walk and hang out with friends that day. So she hang Teru teru b≈çzu, hoping for the rain cloud would go away.

my friends and family have quite unique reactions to my paintings. they thought that a white little thing hanging in the window is a ghost. I said no, that is teru-teru. Just for you guys to know my favorite part of the painting is the tiny teru-teru and the little garden on the corner. And the least favorite part is the cloud, why? because it was the hardest part to paint. I hope I am getting better at painting a cloud.
