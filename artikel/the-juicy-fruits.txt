the juicy fruits

this is my very first painting on canvas. I painted it on 30th July 2022 getting inspiration from pixabay. I start the painting by sketching the fruits beginning with the lemon as the center, and then I continue sketching the grapes, watermelon, orange, pear, pineapple mango, strawberry, apple, avocado, and last peach. I kind of forget how to mix colors using just the three prime colors. but I figured it out somehow. my favorite part of the painting is the lemon and banana, maybe it is because I like yellow, but I think the shadow and color really good on those parts. The hardest part to paint is the pineapple because it has a lot of detail and I am using a lot of colors just for it. the overlap effect is just randomly and the principle is that each fruit has to overlap. the background color that I choose just follows the original picture, cause I think that it is good to complement the fruit's color.
