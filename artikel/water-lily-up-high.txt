Water Lily up high

For the first time, I am using one dominant colour in my painting, blue, which is not like using such a colourful palette. now I challenge myself just to use a minor variation of colour. this painting was made on 10th September 2022, thanks to Dan Scott and Amita Dand that give me resources also inspiration. 

As usual, I want to tell you about my favourite part of this painting, which is the shadow or the reflection on the water. So I just learn about how to paint reflection, and I just practised it. I am sure that there are a lot of aspects that can be improved, but for now, I am proud of myself because I figured out a new lesson about painting.

The most challenging part of this painting is the reflection of reeds on the water because it has a lot of colours not like the mountain that just had one kind of colour. Also, I still find it hard to paint clouds, so I just let the sky without any clouds.
